== Introduction to OMERO annotations

[[overview-strucured-annotations]]
=== OMERO and structured annotations

Examples of how you can annotate your data as an OMERO user:

* Tag, rate or comment on your projects / datasets / images (or screens / plates / images) individually
  using the graphical user interface in OMERO.insight or OMERO.web.
* Let the webtagging tool automatically suggest tags from your image names for you to review and
  apply interactively in OMERO.web.
* Bulk annotate your datasets and images (or plates / plate runs / images) using the CSV tool script
  in OMERO.insight or OMERO.web.

=== OMERO insight annotations

For general usage of annotations in OMERO, please see the OME tutorial at

=== OMERO webtagging

For detailed instructions on how to use the webtagging tool, please see the tool's documentation at

[[overview-omero-cat]]
=== OMERO csvtools

Workflow outline (details below):

. Optionally export your current data to a seed CSV file.
. Attach the tag definitions in CSV format to your OMERO project / dataset (or screen / plate / plate run).
. Run the CSV annotation tool script on the project / dataset (or screen / plate / plate run).

[[supported-omero-cat]]
=== Supported features

The annotation tool relies on the file attachment mechanism provided by OMERO to retrieve the CSV file remotely.

In its current form, it follows OMERO's hierarchical _Project / Dataset / Image_ and _Screen / Plate / Well / Image_
organisation structures to infer the candidates for annotation and CSV file location.

NOTE: The underlying approach follows the convention to *annotate _direct descendants_* in the OMERO data hierarchy,
and to *attach* the CSV file to the annotation targets' *_direct ancestor_*, as illustrated in the table below.

[width="80%", format="csv", options="header"]
|===
Ancestor type / _Attachment target_, Default descendant type / _Annotation target_
Project,Dataset
Dataset,Image
Screen,Plate
Plate,Plate Run
Plate Run,Image
|===

The tool currently allows:

==== For Project / Dataset / Image data

  ** tagging and exporting *datasets* nested _within_ a *project* (ie. ``orphans`` or ``top-level`` datasets are
  currently not supported, but may be at a later stage)
  ** tagging and exporting *images* nested _within_ a *dataset* (whether the dataset is nested within a project or not)
  ** attaching the CSV file to a *project* or a *dataset* (in order to export _datasets_ and _images_,
  respectively)

==== For Screen / Plate / Well / Image data

  ** tagging and exporting *plates* nested _within_ a *screen* (ie. ``orphans`` or ``top-level`` plates are
  currently not supported, but may be at a later stage)
  ** tagging and exporting *plate runs* nested _within_ a *plate*
  ** tagging and exporting *images* nested _within_ a *plate* _without runs_ (whether the plate is nested within a screen or not)
  ** tagging and exporting *images* nested _within_ a *plate run* (for plates with _at least one run_)
  ** attaching the CSV file to a *screen*, a *plate* or a *plate run* (in order to export _plates_,
   _plate runs_ and _images_, respectively).

==== Example data layout

NOTE: CSV attachments names below have been customized to reflect the project, dataset, screen or plate they are
linked to for readability only - in practice, using the default naming for all ranks in the hierarchy
would work equally.

Assuming the following hierarchy and CSV attachments:

----
MyOmeroGroup
  |
  +-- Project-P0  ...................  dataset_tag_P0.csv
  |     +-- Dataset-D1  .............  image_tag_D1.csv
  |     |     +-- Image-D1.1
  |     |     +-- Image-D1.2
  |     +-- Dataset-D2
  +-- Dataset-DN  ...................  image_tag_DN.csv
  |     +-- Image-DN1.1
  |     +-- Image-DN1.2
  |
  +-- Screen-S0  ....................  plate_tag_S0.csv
  |     +-- Plate-P1  ...............  image_tag_P1.csv        <1>
  |     |     +-- Image-P1.1
  |     |     +-- Image-P1.2
  |     +-- Plate-P2
  +-- Plate-PN  ......................  platerun_tag_PN.csv    <2>
        +-- PlateRun-PR1  ............  image_tag_PR1.csv
        |     +-- Image-PR1.1
        |     +-- Image-PR1.2
        +-- PlateRun-PR2
----

<1> No run for `Plate-P1`
<2> One or more runs for `Plate-PN`

The available tagging combinations would be:

|============================================================================================================

WARNING: It is recommended to explicitly define a name for plate runs prior to tagging.
Since the OMERO model doesn't require plate runs to have a name, OMERO.web and insight will generate a default
label for display, based on the run's start and end times if available, or on the run's identifier.
To avoid locale-related discrepancies in timestamp handling when tagging nameless plate runs, OMERO.csvtools
will consider the plate run ID _only_, such that the display label will be formatted as: ``Run <run-id>``.

[[conventions-omero-cat]]
=== Data management conventions

==== Tags file name

If you don't use a specific file name, a default naming scheme is applied.

===== In annotate mode

In _annotate mode_, the default name will be: `*<annotated-type>_<annotation-type>.csv*`, with `*annotated-type*` and
`*annotation-type*` being the supported script arguments.

===== In export mode

In _export mode_, the conventional name will be generated with an additional ``.export`` suffix appended to the
default name: `*<annotated-type>_<annotation-type>.export.csv*`.

Example default file names:

* File containing at least one _tag_ to be applied to at least one _dataset_: *dataset_tag.csv*
* File containing at least one _tag_ to be applied to at least one _image_: *image_tag.csv*

The file content is consequently expected to be of homogenous nature: you cannot mix tags to be
applied to images and datasets in the same file (you would need two files for this).

==== Tags file format

The CSV format is expected to be in the form of:

* An optional column header (ignored by default)
* A line per tagging request, with:
  ** The annotated name as the first column (ie. dataset name or image name)
  ** Any number of tags names as the remaining columns (at least one)

Other default file format parameters which you can customise are:

[width="50%", options="header"]
|====================================
|Parameter            |Default value
|Ignore columns header|true
|Delimiter character  |Comma (,)
|Character encoding   | UTF-8
|====================================

==== Example files

* Example CSV file using the default comma delimiter and a column header
  (link:files/dataset_tag.csv[download])

NOTE: This is currently the default format in use.

----
Dataset Name, Type, Gender
dataset_01, ControlSubject, Female
dataset_02, Male
----

* Example CSV file using an alternate semicolon delimiter and no header
  (link:files/dataset_tag_semicolon_noheader.csv[download])

----
dataset_01;ControlSubject;Female
dataset_02;Male
----

* CSV files bundle

Download all CSV files from the {bintray_examples_dist_url}[examples zip distribution].


[[tutorial-omero-cat]]
=== Usage tutorial

==== Export CSV data

To initialize a CSV file prior to adding new tags, you may run the annotation script in _export mode_
beforehand, then download, edit and delete the generated attachment.

NOTE: If you have used the default naming conventions, you may wish to rename the seed file prior to uploading
      it again for tagging (ie. remove the ``.export`` suffix) for automatic detection on the next run in _annotate mode_.

==== Upload/Download CSV tags file

Use the attachments interface

image::images/attach-file.png[Attach file]

==== Tagging data

Attach your tag file to your OMERO project, dataset, screen, plate or plate run - either with the default name or a name of your choice.

==== Start the CSV annotation tool

* Navigate to the relevant OMERO.scripts menu

image::images/script-menu.png[Script menu]

* Customize the input parameters and launch

image::images/script-ui.png[Script GUI]

TIP: The OMERO.scripts framework usually matches the ``Data Type`` to be pre-selected in the script window
with the currently active item in the left navigation menu.
This is not currently the case when the active item is a *Plate Run* - therefore reviewing and
adjusting the selected script parameters before launching is recommended.

[terminology]
=== Terminology

NOTE: *Plate Acquisition* and *Plate Run* refer to identical OMERO concepts and may be used interchangeably.
Usage throughout this document follows the OMERO convention: the data model (_Plate Acquisition_)
is referenced via its label (_Plate Run_) as the conventional denomination.
